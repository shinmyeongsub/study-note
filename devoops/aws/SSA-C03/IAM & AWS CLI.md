### IAM : Users & Groups
- IAM = Identity and Access Management, <Strong>Global</Strong> service
- <Strong>Root account</Strong> created by default, shouldn't be used or shared
- <Strong>Users</Strong> are people within your organization, and can be grouped
- <Strong>Groups</Strong> only contain users, not other groups
- Users don't have to belong to a group, and user can belong to multiple groups

### IAM : Permissions
- <Strong>Users or Groups</Strong> can be assigned JSON documents called policies
- These policies define the <Strong>permissions</Strong> of the users
- In AWS you apply the <Strong>least privilege principle</Strong> : don't give more permissions than a user needs
